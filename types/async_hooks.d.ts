/**
 * We strongly discourage the use of the `async_hooks` API.
 * Other APIs that can cover most of its use cases include:
 *
 * * [`AsyncLocalStorage`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/async_context.html#class-asynclocalstorage) tracks async context
 * * [`process.getActiveResourcesInfo()`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/process.html#processgetactiveresourcesinfo) tracks active resources
 *
 * The `async_hooks` module provides an API to track asynchronous resources.
 * It can be accessed using:
 *
 * ```js
 * import async_hooks from 'async_hooks';
 * ```
 * @experimental
 * @see [source](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v22.x/lib/async_hooks.js)

   * fs.open(path, 'r', (err, fd) => {
   *   console.log(executionAsyncId());  // 6 - open()
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * The ID returned from `executionAsyncId()` is related to execution timing, not

   *
   * Using `executionAsyncResource()` in the top-level execution context will
   * return an empty object as there is no handle or request object to use,
   * but having an object representing the top-level can be helpful.
