//! All `unsafe` code and raw-pointer plumbing for this crate is centralized in
//! this module, as required by the implementation plan. Two independent
//! concerns are handled here:
//!
//! 1. **Stable identity for wasmi handles.** `wasmi::Func`/`Memory`/`Table`/
//!    `Global` do not implement `PartialEq`/`Hash` (only `Instance` does), so
//!    the wrapper-identity registries in [`crate::realm`] cannot use the
//!    handles directly as hash keys. All four types are `#[repr(transparent)]`
//!    newtypes around an 8-byte `Copy` arena index (mirroring wasmi's own
//!    internal `size_of::<Func>() == size_of::<u64>()` invariant, see
//!    `wasmi::reftype` tests), so we reinterpret the bytes as a `u64` purely as
//!    an opaque, stable-for-this-store equality/hash key. We never interpret
//!    the bits as an address or attempt to reconstruct a handle from them.
//!
//! 2. **Reentrant access to the realm's `Store` from host callbacks.** QuickJS
//!    executes a single realm on a single thread, but a JS import callback can
//!    call back into an exported Wasm function of the *same* instance while
//!    the outer `wasmi::Func::call` still holds the store borrow via its
//!    `Caller`. Rather than borrowing the `Store` a second time (which would
//!    panic/deadlock), nested calls reuse the currently active `Caller` through
//!    a thread-local RAII stack. Because QuickJS/this runtime is single
//!    threaded and a `Caller<'_, StoreData>` never survives past the host
//!    function invocation that created it, storing a raw pointer to it for the
//!    dynamic extent of that call is sound as long as the stack is always
//!    popped (via `ActiveCallerGuard::drop`) before the frame that pushed it
//!    returns or unwinds.
