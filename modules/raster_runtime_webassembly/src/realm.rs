//! Per-realm `WasmRealm` (the `wasmi::Store` + [`HostState`] pair) and the
//! private, non-enumerable/non-configurable holder object that anchors its
//! lifetime to a single QuickJS context's `globalThis`.
//!
//! We deliberately do *not* use `Ctx::store_userdata` to store the `Store`
//! *directly* the way the implementation plan originally sketched (see the
//! plan's own caveat): in rquickjs 0.12.1 that storage is keyed off
//! `JS_GetRuntimeOpaque`, i.e. it is shared by every `JSContext` that lives on
//! the same `JSRuntime` -- including the bare child contexts created by
//! `vm.runInNewContext`/`vm.createContext`. A single realm's `Store` would
//! therefore leak into unrelated child contexts if it were the *only* thing
//! keyed there.
//!
//! Instead we use a hybrid of two mechanisms:
//!
//! 1. A private native holder ([`WasmRealmHolder`]) is installed directly on
//!    `globalThis`, holding *only* a plain `u64` realm id (plus a handle to a
//!    plain, non-GC-reachable removal queue -- see point 3 below) -- no
//!    `Ctx`, no `Persistent`, nothing GC-cycle-shaped.
//! 2. The actual [`WasmRealm`] (which, transitively through [`HostState`],
//!    owns every `Persistent<Value/Object/Function/Constructor>` this crate
//!    ever creates -- the callback/wrapper/externref registries, the pending
//!    exception slot, the captured error constructors) lives in a
//!    [`RealmRegistry`] stored via `Ctx::store_userdata`, keyed internally by
//!    realm id so that multiple realms safely share the one per-`Runtime`
//!    userdata slot.
//! 3. When a [`WasmRealmHolder`] is finalized, it queues its realm id into a
//!    `condemned` list rather than removing it from the registry itself (see
//!    that type's own doc comment for why); [`reap_condemned`] drains that
//!    list from ordinary (non-finalizer) call sites. In practice, per
//!    rquickjs 0.12.1's own behavior, a `WasmRealmHolder` is *not* finalized
//!    until its whole `AsyncRuntime` is torn down (see the
//!    `context_teardown_defers_realm_removal_until_runtime_teardown` test in
//!    this module's `tests` submodule for the empirical confirmation and
//!    full explanation); this split is still worth keeping; both because it
//!    is the only mechanism that can behave correctly if that upstream
//!    behavior ever changes, and because it is what makes eventual removal
//!    (whenever it happens) safe -- see point 3's cross-reference below.
//!
//! Why this split, and not simply putting `Rc<WasmRealm>` directly inside
//! [`WasmRealmHolder`] (as an earlier iteration of this module did)? Because
//! `rquickjs::Persistent`'s own documentation is direct about this:
//!
//! > Be careful and ensure that no persistent links outlives the runtime,
//! > otherwise Runtime will abort the process when dropped.
//!
//! This is *not* a QuickJS GC cycle-collection problem -- no `Trace`/
//! `Tracer::mark_ctx` scheme fixes it, because it is not a cycle at all in the
//! sense the collector understands. It is simply that a live `Persistent`
//! embeds a real, `JS_DupContext`-backed `Ctx`, and *nothing* ever frees that
//! dup unless the `Persistent` itself is dropped -- and a native class
//! instance reachable only via ordinary (non-cyclic) JS refcounting is not
//! guaranteed to be finalized before `AsyncRuntime`/`AsyncContext` run their
//! own `Drop` chain. This was confirmed empirically (see the bisection tests
//! in this module's `tests` submodule during development): even a
//! `Persistent` held in a plain, JS-unreachable `thread_local` map, or inside
//! a class whose `Trace` is a genuine no-op, aborts the process at
//! `JS_FreeRuntime` if it is still alive when the `Runtime` is dropped.
//!
//! The one place a live `Persistent` is *guaranteed* to be dropped before
//! `JS_FreeRuntime` runs is `Ctx`/`Runtime`-userdata: rquickjs's
//! `RawRuntime::drop` explicitly calls `Opaque::clear()` (which drops all
//! userdata) *before* calling `qjs::JS_FreeRuntime`. Routing every
//! `Persistent`-owning structure through `store_userdata` -- rather than
//! through a `Trace`d class field -- is therefore both necessary and
//! sufficient, and needs no `unsafe`/cycle-collector involvement at all.
